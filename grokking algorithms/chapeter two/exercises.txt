2.1 - Suppose you’re building an app to keep track of your finances.
Every day, you write down everything you spent money on. At the
end of the month, you review your expenses and sum up how much
you spent. So, you have lots of inserts and a few reads. Should you
use an array or a list? 
R: Linked Lists, cause the run time to insert is better than arrays, you will only read it once in the month but will 
insert lots of time. Arrays have fast reads and slow inserts, and Linked Lists have slow reads and fast inserts, but
linked list only have a slow read if each elements is stored in random spaces, in the case you’re reading every element 
in the list it will do well on reads
