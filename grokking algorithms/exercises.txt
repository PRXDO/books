1.1 - Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching
through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of
steps it would take? 
R: The maximum number of steps is 7

1.2 - Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum
number of steps now?
R: The maximum number of steps will be 8

1.3 - You have a name, and you want to find the person’s phone
number in the phone book. 
R: Using binary search with a O(log n) run time

1.4 - You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s
name in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through
the whole book!)
R: Using linear search with a O(n) run time

1.5 - You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book
R: using linear search with a O(n) run time

1.6 - You want to read the numbers of just the As.
